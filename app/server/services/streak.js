/**
 * Streak rules, exactly as specified for Giao duc tai chinh:
 *
 *  - The first qualifying action of a calendar day (+1): finishing a lesson, or
 *    using one of the three tools (budget / goals / expenses).
 *  - Miss the next day and the streak FREEZES rather than breaking.
 *  - The freeze holds for at most 3 missed days.
 *  - Come back on any of those days and the streak continues (+1).
 *  - Miss a 4th day and the streak is lost; the next action starts again at 1.
 *
 * So with `gap` = days since the last active day:
 *    gap 0        already counted today, nothing changes
 *    gap 1        normal consecutive day            -> +1
 *    gap 2..4     1..3 frozen days were used        -> +1 (streak survived)
 *    gap >= 5     more than 3 days missed           -> reset to 1
